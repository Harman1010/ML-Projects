This project is about creating a supervised ML model which predicts the hearing test of a person ( 0 for fail 1 for pass) based on two aspects ----- age and physical score

                                                                     RANGE OF ASPECTS
Age : 18-90
Physical score : 0-50
 
                                                                 WHAT I DID IN THIS PROJECT

Evaluated different supervised ML algorithms to check which algo gives best accuracy score and then used it with tkinter to create GUI for predicting new data.

                                                                  IS THIS THE FINAL PROJECT?
No, there is always room for improvement. Will keep updating the project as I get new ideas.

                                                                     LETS' WORK TOGETHER
If you have any new ideas,you can fork the project and pull requests.
